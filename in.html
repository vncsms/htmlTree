The metropolis is anchor to the Belo Horizonte metropolitan area, ranked as the third most populous metropolitan area in Brazil and the seventeenth most populous in the Americas. Belo Horizonte is the capital of the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil's second most populous state. It is the first planned modern city in Brazil.↵</p><p><br/></p><p>The region was first settled in the early 18th century, but the city as it is known today was planned and constructed in the 1890s, to replace Ouro Preto as the capital of Minas Gerais. The city features a mixture of contemporary and classical buildings, and is home to several modern Brazilian architectural icons, most notably the Pampulha Complex. In planning the city, Aar&#227;o Reis and Francisco Bicalho sought inspiration in the urban planning of Washington, D.C. The city has employed notable programs in urban revitalization and food security, for which it has been awarded international accolades.↵</p><p><br/></p><p>The city is built on several hills and is completely surrounded by mountains. There are several large parks in the immediate surroundings of Belo Horizonte. The Mangabeiras Park (Parque das Mangabeiras), 6&#160;km (4&#160;mi) southeast of the city centre in the hills of Curral Ridge (Serra do Curral), has a broad view of the city. It has an area of 2.35&#160;km<sup>2</sup> (580 acres), of which 0.9&#160;km<sup>2</sup> (220 acres) is covered by the native forest. The Jambeiro Woods (Mata do Jambeiro) nature reserve extends over 912 hectares (2,250 acres), with vegetation typical of the Atlantic Forest. More than 100 species of birds inhabit the reserve, as well as 10 species of mammals.↵</p><p><br/></p><p>Belo Horizonte was one of the host cities of the 1950 and the 2014 FIFA World Cup. Additionally, the city shared the host of the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup and the football tournament during the 2016 Summer Olympics.↵</p><p><br/></p>↵<h1><span>History</span></h1><p><br/></p>↵<div class="thumb tleft image-float-left"><img class="thumbimage" data-hd-img="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/Planta_BH.jpg/2000px-Planta_BH.jpg" data-md-img="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/Planta_BH.jpg/220px-Planta_BH.jpg" decoding="async" height="152" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/Planta_BH.jpg/220px-Planta_BH.jpg" width="220"/><span class="image-caption" style="width:220px"> Belo Horizonte plan in 1895.</span> </div>↵<p>The metropolis was once a small village, founded by Jo&#227;o Leite da Silva Ortiz, a bandeirante explorer from S&#227;o Paulo. The explorer settled in the region in 1701, leaving a gold rush expedition. He then established a farm called "Curral d'el Rey", archaic Portuguese for the "King's Corral", which in modern Portuguese would be spelled <i>Curral do Rei</i>. The farm's wealth and success encouraged people from surrounding places to move into the region, and Curral del Rey became a village surrounded by farms.↵</p><p><br/></p><p>Another important factor contributing to the growth of the village was the migrants from the S&#227;o Francisco River region, who had to pass through Curral d'el Rey to reach southern parts of Brazil. Travelers usually visited a small wooden chapel, where they prayed for a safe trip. Due to this fact, the chapel was named Capela da Nossa Senhora da Boa Viagem, which means "Chapel of Our Lady of the Good Journey." After the construction of Belo Horizonte, the old baroque chapel was replaced by a neo-gothic church that became the city's cathedral.↵</p><p><br/></p>↵<div class="thumb tright image-float-right"><img class="thumbimage" data-hd-img="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/01/Inauguracaobh.jpg/2000px-Inauguracaobh.jpg" data-md-img="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/01/Inauguracaobh.jpg/220px-Inauguracaobh.jpg" decoding="async" height="154" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/01/Inauguracaobh.jpg/220px-Inauguracaobh.jpg" width="220"/><span class="image-caption" style="width:220px"> Founding of the city in 1897.</span> </div>↵<p>The previous capital of Minas Gerais, Ouro Preto (meaning "black gold", due to dark rocks with gold inside found on the region), originally called "Vila Rica" ("wealthy village"), was a symbol of both the monarchic Brazilian Empire and the period when most of Brazilian income was due to mining. That never pleased the members of the Inconfid&#234;ncia Mineira, republican intellectuals who conspired against the Portuguese dominion of Brazil. In 1889, Brazil became a republic, and it was agreed that a new state capital, in tune with a modern and prosperous Minas Gerais, had to be set.↵</p><p><br/></p><p>In 1893, due to the climatic and topographic conditions, Curral Del Rey was selected by Minas Gerais governor Afonso Pena among other cities as the location for the new economic and cultural centre of the state, under the new name of "Cidade de Minas," or City of Minas.↵</p><p><br/></p><p>Aar&#227;o Reis, an urbanist from the State of Par&#225;, was then set to design the second planned city of Brazil (the first one is Teresina). Cidade de Minas was inaugurated in 1897, with many unfinished constructions as the Brazilian government set a deadline for its completion. Inhabitation of the city was subsidised by the local government, through the concession of free empty lots and funding for building houses. An interesting feature of Reis' downtown street plan for Belo Horizonte was the inclusion of a symmetrical array of perpendicular and diagonal streets named after Brazilian states and Brazilian indigenous tribes.↵</p><p><br/></p>↵<div class="thumb tright image-float-right"><span class="image-caption" style="width:220px"> Belo Horizonte, 1970s, National Archives of Brazil</span> </div>↵<p>In 1906, the name was changed to Belo Horizonte. At that time the city was experiencing a considerable industrial expansion that increased its commercial and service sectors. From its very beginning, the city's original plan prohibited workers to live inside the urban area which was defined by Avenida do Contorno (a long avenue which goes around the city's central areas), reserved for the public sector functionaries (hence the name of the trendy neighbourhood "Funcion&#225;rios"), and bringing about an accelerated occupation outside the city's area well provided with infrastructure since its very beginning. Obviously, the city's original planners did not count on its population growth afterwards, which proved especially intense in the last 20 years of the 20th century.↵</p><p><br/></p><p>In the 1940s, a young Oscar Niemeyer designed the Pampulha Neighbourhood to great acclaim, a commission he got thanks to then-mayor, soon-to-be-president Juscelino Kubitschek. These two men are largely responsible for the wide avenues, large lakes, parks and jutting skylines that characterise the city today. A 1949 American government film favorably reviewed the planning and building of the city.↵</p><p><br/></p><p>Belo Horizonte is fast becoming a regional centre of commerce. The Latin American Research and development centre of Google, situated in Belo Horizonte, was responsible for the management and operation of the former social networking website Orkut. It continues to be a trendsetter in the arts, particularly where music, literature, architecture and the avant-garde are concerned.↵</p><p><br/></p>↵<h1><span>Geography</span></h1><p><br/></p>↵<dl><dd><i>See also: List of bairros of Belo Horizonte</i></dd></dl>↵<h2><span>Surrounding cities and metropolitan area</span></h2><p><br/></p>↵<div class="thumb tleft image-float-left"><img class="thumbimage" data-hd-img="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/74/Belo_Horizonte_at_night.jpg/2000px-Belo_Horizonte_at_night.jpg" data-md-img="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/74/Belo_Horizonte_at_night.jpg/260px-Belo_Horizonte_at_night.jpg" decoding="async" height="173" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/74/Belo_Horizonte_at_night.jpg/260px-Belo_Horizonte_at_night.jpg" width="260"/><span class="image-caption" style="width:260px"> Belo Horizonte from ISS at night.</span> </div>↵<p>The term "Grande BH" ("Greater Belo Horizonte") denotes any of various definitions for the metropolitan area of Belo Horizonte.

The geology largely comprises crystalline rocks, which give rise to the varied morphology of the landscape. It is located in a large geological unit known as the craton of San Francisco, referring to extensive crustal nucleus of central-eastern Brazil, tectonically stable at the end of the Paleoproterozoic and bordering areas that suffered the regeneration at the Neoproterozoic.↵</p><p><br/></p><p>The archean rocks members of Belo Horizonte complex and supracrustal sequences of the Paleoproterozoic is predominant. The area of Belo Horizonte complex includes the geomorphological unit called <i>Depression of Belo Horizonte</i>, which represents about 70% of the municipality area and has its greatest expression in the northern Ribeir&#227;o Arrudas (Rues Stream) pipeline. The metasedimentary rocks has its area of occurrence on the south of Ribeir&#227;o Arrudas pipeline, constituting about 30% of the area of Belo Horizonte. The characteristics of this area are lithological diversities and rugged topography, which has its maximum expression in the <i>Serra do Curral</i> (Corral Ridge), the southern boundary of the municipality.↵</p><p><br/></p><p>Its soil comprises a succession of layers of rocks of varied composition, represented by itabirite, dolomite, quartzite, filities and schists different from the general direction northwest-southeast and dip to the southeast. The hills of Belo Horizonte are part of the Espinha&#231;o Mountains and belong to the larger Itacolomi mountain chain.

There are neighborhoods that had very high human development indexes in 2000 (equal to or greater than the indexes of some Scandinavian countries), but those in the lower range (in line with, for example, North Africa). Carmo/Sion (0.973): greater than Iceland - 0.968; Cruzeiro/Anchieta/Funcion&#225;rios (0.970): greater than Iceland - 0.968; Grajau/Gutierrez (0.965): greater than Australia - 0.962; Belvedere/Mangabeiras/Comiteco (0.964): greater than Australia &#8211; 0.962; Serra/S&#227;o Lucas (0.953): equal to Japan, Netherlands &#8211; 0.953.↵</p><p><br/></p><p>In 1993, under mayor Patrus Ananias de Souza, the city started a series of innovations based on its citizens having the "right to food". These include, for example, creating farmers' markets in the town to enable direct sales and regularly surveying market prices and posting the results across the city. The city's process of participatory budgeting was linked with these innovations, as a result of which the infant mortality rate was reduced by 50% in a decade. There is some evidence that these programs have helped support a higher quality of life for the local farmers partnering with the city and that this may be having positive effects on biodiversity in the Atlantic rainforest around the city. The city's development of these policies garnered the first "Future Policy Award" in 2009, awarded by the World Future Council, a group of 50 activists (including Frances Moore Lapp&#233;, Vandana Shiva, Wes Jackson, and Youssou N'Dour) concerned with the development and recognition of policies to promote a just and sustainable future.↵</p><p><br/></p><p>The city has undertaken an internationally heralded project called Vila Viva ("Living Village" in Portuguese) that promises to "urbanize" the poorest areas (<i>favelas</i>), relocating families from areas with high risk of floods and landslides but keeping them in the same neighborhood, paving main avenues to allow public transportation, police and postal service to have access. All the work is done with 80% of locals, reducing unemployment and increasing family income. Former mayor Fernando da Mata Pimentel was nominated for World Mayor in 2005 on the strength of these and other programs.↵</p><p><br/></p>↵<h1><span>Economy</span></h1><p><br/></p>↵<div class="thumb tleft image-float-left"><img class="thumbimage" data-hd-img="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Belo_Horizonte_-_Avenida_Afonso_Pena.jpg/2000px-Belo_Horizonte_-_Avenida_Afonso_Pena.jpg" data-md-img="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Belo_Horizonte_-_Avenida_Afonso_Pena.jpg/170px-Belo_Horizonte_-_Avenida_Afonso_Pena.jpg" decoding="async" height="256" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Belo_Horizonte_-_Avenida_Afonso_Pena.jpg/170px-Belo_Horizonte_-_Avenida_Afonso_Pena.jpg" width="170"/><span class="image-caption" style="width:170px"> Afonso Pena Avenue.</span> </div>↵<p>Belo Horizonte receives large numbers of visitors, as it is in the Brazilian main economic axis, exerting influence even on other states. Multinational and Brazilian companies, such as Google and Oi, maintain offices in the city. The service sector plays a very important role in the economy of Belo Horizonte, being responsible for 85% of the city's gross domestic product (GDP), with the industry making up for most of the remaining 15%. Belo Horizonte has a developed industrial sector, being traditionally a hub of the Brazilian siderurgical and metallurgical industries, as the state of Minas Gerais has always been very rich in minerals, specifically iron ore.↵</p><p><br/></p><p>Belo Horizonte is the distribution and processing centre of a rich agricultural and mining region and the nucleus of a burgeoning industrial complex. Production is centred on steel, steel products, automobiles, and textiles. Gold, manganese, and gemstones mined in the surrounding region are processed in the city.↵The main industrial district of the city was set during the 1940s in Contagem, a part of greater Belo Horizonte. Multinational companies like FIAT (which opened its plant in Betim in 1974), Arcelor, and Toshiba have subsidiaries in the region, along with other textile like Group Rachelle Textil, Ematex and Cedro Textil, cosmetic, food, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, furnishing and refractory companies. Among the companies headquartered in the city we can list steel producer A&#231;ominas (held by Gerdau, one of the largest multinationals originated in Brazil); Usiminas; Belgo-Mineira (held by Arcelor); Acesita (partially held by Arcelor); mobile communication Vivo; and Telecom Italia Mobile, Dasein executive search, executive coaching company, as well as the NYSE-listed electrical company CEMIG. Leading steel product makers Sumitomo Metals of Japan and Vallourec of France have also plans to construct an integrated steel works on the outskirts of the city.↵</p><p><br/></p>↵<div class="thumb tright image-float-right"><img class="thumbimage" data-hd-img="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Usiminas.JPG/2000px-Usiminas.JPG" data-md-img="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Usiminas.JPG/220px-Usiminas.JPG" decoding="async" height="165" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Usiminas.JPG/220px-Usiminas.JPG" width="220"/><span class="image-caption" style="width:220px"> Headquarters of Usiminas in Pedro Melo Square.</span> </div>↵<p>There are also a large number of small enterprises in the technological sector with regional to nationwide success, particularly in the fields of computing and biotechonology. Because of both governmental and private funding in the diversification of its economy, the city has become an international reference in Information Technology and Biotechnology, and is also cited because of the advanced corporate and university research in Biodiesel fuel. The number of jobs in the Information sector has been growing at annual rates above 50%. The Belo Horizonte Metropolitan Area, composed of 33 cities under the capital's direct influence, is home to 16% of the country's biotechnology companies, with annual sales of over R$550&#160;million.↵</p><p><br/></p><p>Projects in these fields are likely to expand because of integration between universities, the oil company Petrobras and the Brazilian Government. One of the largest events that ever took place in the city, the Inter-American Development Bank meeting, occurred in 2005 and attracted people from everywhere in the world.↵</p><p><br/></p><p>For a long time it was marked by the predominance of its industrial sector, but from the 1990s there has been a constant expansion of the service sector economy, particularly in computer science, biotechnology, business tourism, fashion and the making of jewelry. The city is considered to be a strategic leader in the Brazilian economy. The move towards business tourism transformed the capital into a national hub for this segment of the tourist industry.↵</p><p><br/></p>↵<ul><li>In 2008, the city's GDP was R$42&#160;billion (or about of US$26,2&#160;billion).</li>↵<li>In 2008, the Greater Belo Horizonte's GDP was R$98,5&#160;billion (or about of US$61&#160;billion).</li>↵<li>In 2008, the city's per capita income was R$17,313 (or US$10,820).

It is located in the municipalities of Lagoa Santa and Confins, 38 kilometres (24&#160;mi) from Belo Horizonte, and was opened in January 1984. Plans for gradual expansion to meet growing demand had been already drawn up from the airport's inception. The airport has one of the lowest rates of shutdown for bad weather in the country. It ran at limited capacity until 2005, when a large proportion of Pampulha Airport air traffic was transferred to Confins. There are direct international flights to/from Miami, Orlando, Lisbon, Buenos Aires and Panama City.</li>↵<li>Pampulha &#8211; Carlos Drummond de Andrade Airport, dedicated to domestic traffic;</li>↵<li>Carlos Prates Airport, dedicated to general aviation.</li></ul>↵<h2><span>Highways</span></h2><p><br/></p>↵<p>The city is connected to the rest of Minas Gerais state and the country by a number of roadways. Minas Gerais has the country's largest federal highway network.↵</p><p><br/></p>↵<ul><li>BR-040 connects Belo Horizonte to Rio de Janeiro (going south) and Bras&#237;lia (going northwest). It also links other cities in the state, such as Juiz de Fora, Conselheiro Lafaiete, Barbacena, Sete Lagoas, and Paracatu.</li>↵<li>BR-262 begins in Mato Grosso do Sul and ends in Esp&#237;rito Santo, crossing Minas Gerais from west to east. It links Belo Horizonte to Par&#225; de Minas, Arax&#225;, Manhua&#231;u, Uberaba, Governador Valadares, and Vit&#243;ria, the capital of Esp&#237;rito Santo state.</li>↵<li>BR-381 is an important federal highway. It connects Belo Horizonte to S&#227;o Paulo.</li>↵<li>MG-010 is a state highway that connects the capital to the Tancredo Neves International Airport, itself located in the municipalities of Confins and Lagoa Santa, which are part of the metropolitan area of Belo Horizonte. Starting in 2005, several flights were transferred from the Pampulha Regional Airport to the international airport. To improve access to the international airport, MG-010 is being expanded (effectively duplicating its lanes).</li></ul>↵<p>The city is also served by other minor roads such as state highways MG-020, MG-050, MG-030, and MG-433. There is also an East-West Express Way, which goes from the city to the nearby industrial centres of Contagem and Betim (together having a population of ca. 900,000), and Anel Rodovi&#225;rio, a kind of "beltway" &#8211; indeed it is not circumferential, but connects many highways, such as the federal (BR-ones) so it is not necessary for a large number of cars and trucks to pass through the city centre. Many of these roads are in poor condition, but in the last years many revitalization and rebuilding projects have been started.↵</p><p><br/></p>↵<h2><span>Bus system</span></h2><p><br/></p>↵<p>The bus system has a large number of bus lines going through all parts in the city, and is administrated by <i>BHTRANS</i>. Among the upcoming projects are the expansion of the integration between bus lines and the metro, with integrated stations, many already in use. And the construction of bus corridors, with lanes and bus stops exclusively for the bus lines. Keeping buses from traffic congestions, making the trips more viable for commuters.↵</p><p><br/></p>↵<h2><span>Railways</span></h2><p><br/></p>↵<p>Belo Horizonte Metro or MetroBH started operating at the end of the 1970s. There is one line, with 19 stations, from Vilarinho to Eldorado Station, in Contagem, transporting over 160,000 people daily. The current projects of expansion include Line 2, linking the existing Calafate Station to the region of Barreiro. And Line 3, from the city's main bus terminal to Savassi economical district. Line 2 is planned to be overground (similar to the current line) and Line 3 is planned to be underground, passing through the city's financial centre, Pra&#231;a Sete and Afonso Pena Avenue.

Besides these, another three spaces are already in the process of being implemented: the Casa Fiat de Cultura (Fiat Culture House), CENA and Oi Futuro. The proposal, according to the Circuit manager, Cristiana Kumaira, is to strengthen the circuit in the world cultural context. &#8220;We are already on this path and are being careful to ensure that the activities, services and assistance fulfill the needs and expectations of both the local population and the tourists who come to Belo Horizonte from around the world.

The opportunity came with the transference of the Minas Gerais Government headquarters to the Cidade Administrativa (Administrative City), in Serra Verde.

According to Kumaira, this public-private partnership model allows large companies to participate and effectively contribute to the cultural advance of the city. &#8220;Beyond their fields of activities, the partners invest in the implantation and maintenance of museums, learning spaces, exhibitions rooms and shows, as well as memory centers that consolidate the history of Minas Gerais, presenting it either for free or at affordable prices&#8221;, she adds.↵↵</p><p><br/></p>↵<div class="thumb tright image-float-right"><img class="thumbimage" data-hd-img="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/be/Jardimbotanico6.jpg/2000px-Jardimbotanico6.jpg" data-md-img="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/be/Jardimbotanico6.jpg/220px-Jardimbotanico6.jpg" decoding="async" height="165" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/be/Jardimbotanico6.jpg/220px-Jardimbotanico6.jpg" width="220"/><span class="image-caption" style="width:220px"> Botanical garden of UFMG.</span> </div>↵<p>The Natural History Museum and Botanical Garden holds an important treasure of folk art &#8211; the Nativity of Pipiripau.

The building was designed by Oscar Niemeyer and it also houses the Minas Gerais Handcraft Center. The Pampulha Art Museum is located at the Pampulha Lake in Belo Horizonte in a building that originally housed the Pampulha Casino. The building was designed by Oscar Niemeyer, commissioned by the then mayor and future president of Brazil Juscelino Kubitschek in the early 1940s, with external grounds by landscaper Roberto Burle Marx. The building was the first project of Oscar Niemeyer, opened as a casino, and closed in 1946. In 1957, it was re-opened as the Art Museum. His design was influenced by the principles of Le Corbusier. The gardens of Burle Marx are an tribute to the tropical green. There is three sculptures by Ceschiatti, Zamoiski and Jos&#233; Pedrosa. In 1996, it won new multimedia rooms, library, caf&#233; bar, souvenir shop and technical infrastructure. The MAP has an impressive collection of 1.600 works.

It is at the Pampulha complex that one can see the routes of this new architecture movement. The modern and protomodern architecture can also be seen all over Belo Horizonte, either in emblematic 1950's buildings such as Edificio Acaiaca, Conjunto JK, Hotel Amazonas and former Hotel Excelsior, all reflecting the modernity culture of the first planned capital of Brazil.↵</p><p><br/></p><p>The Pampulha Park area includes one of the largest soccer stadiums in the world, the Mineir&#227;o stadium, and the S&#227;o Francisco de Assis Church, widely known as Igreja da Pampulha, designed by Brazilian Modernist architect Oscar Niemeyer.
